        There are many types of ways to use images. They can be the focus of the website or display information to users. 
        When deciding on the technology a web gallery is built with, we should consider how the gallery’s functionality 
        and design supports our client’s website.

        With the popularity of smartphones and tablets, responsive design has become more prevalent. This makes it more 
        crucial for websites that focuses around photo-based (photo portfolios) content to be responsive and mobile friendly. 
        To assist the development of the website, we can turn to a third-party plugin. Carrie Cousins of designshack.net writes, 
        “Using a container for images such as a slider or gallery can help you better manage responsive images in your website 
        design. Particularly if you are using a well-known and established third-party tool, most of the heavy lifting is done 
        for you in ensuring these elements will work as intended (Cousins).” Some third-party tools to note are “LayerSlider” 
        and “Flickity;” both are jQuery plugins catered towards responsive web design.

        Websites that present the user with information (online retail) may need to focus more on Search Engine Optimization 
        (SEO). Good practice of SEO tracts more people to your client’s site. Nika of artcld.com mentions, “To really stand 
        out from other galleries, consider including a resources section on your site that serves as a virtual art consultant. 
        Why? In 2018, many people start the process of buying anything by going straight to their favorite search engine. 
        By providing helpful, written content on your website, you can reach people early on in the buying process when they're 
        searching for information. (Nika).” There are plugins, such as “LayerSlider,” but we can also accomplish this ourselves 
        by adding captions to basic HTML galleries.
    </p>

        Galleries can be tackled through various methods. We can rely on third party plugins or design one ourselves. Depending on 
        what our client needs, it is recommended to look into what certain gallery plugins have to offer and what our client website 
        needs to accomplish.
