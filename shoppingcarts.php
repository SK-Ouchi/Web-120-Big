    <p>When it comes to e-commerce sites, we will need a way for our customers to add their items while shopping. 
    We could build one ourselves, but that is not recommended. Shopping carts are demanding. If not built the 
    correct way, you may lose business. In a poll by One Poll, 25% of people drop their shopping carts because 
    they have to re-enter their shipping info and 30% of people drop their carts because they have to re-enter 
    their credit card info (see fig.1).</p>

    <p>That is too great of a risk, especially if we are the ones liable for it. It may be preferred to use a third-party 
    shopping cart. Two popular ones are Shopify and Magneto. Shopify is based on Ruby on Rails framework. Shopify can 
    recover abandoned carts for each user, supports multiple ways payment (PayPal, Bitcoin etc.), offer free shipping 
    and provides 24/7 customer support. Magneto, written in PHP, supports multiple ways of payment, guest checkout, and 
    tout better developer customization. They overlap in many ways but differ in others. Depending on our customer’s needs,
    we may prefer one over the other. In an age where e-commerce has become popular, small business may choose to expand 
    through the web.  A glaring issue also highlighted by One Poll is people abandoning their shopping carts due to shipping; 
    being responsible for a 63% loss in business. Shopify may not be the one to pick. Rachel Gearinger of Creativeminds writes, 
    “One con is that in Shopify, business owners with the lower tier pricing plans aren’t able to view real-time shipping rates,
    which could result in higher shipping rates for customers (Gearinger).” If our client is a small shop owner, they would not 
    profit as much as they would using another shopping-cart. Magneto offers a community free edition which would give shop owners 
    profit flexibility.</p>
